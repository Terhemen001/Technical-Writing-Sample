# From Local Prototype to Cloud Deployment: Shipping AI Agents Responsibly

## Introduction

Most AI projects die between:
- “It works on my machine”
- “Users are depending on it”

This guide walks through the journey from **local prototype to production deployment**.

---

## Challenges of Deploying AI Agents

- Configuration drift
- Secret management
- Scaling workflows
- Debugging failures

Ignoring these guarantees failure.

---

## Preparing for Production

Before deployment:
- Externalize configuration
- Secure secrets
- Add logging and tracing

Production is hostile. Prepare accordingly.

---

## Deployment Strategies

Options include:
- Managed platforms
- Dedicated servers
- Event-driven execution

Choose based on:
- Reliability needs
- Cost
- Latency

---

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

Track:
- Failures
- Latency
- Model behavior changes

Deployment is not the end—it’s the beginning.

---

## Conclusion

Shipping AI responsibly is an engineering discipline.

The model is only one piece of the system.
